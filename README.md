# Eat-Da-Burger!
## Description
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
<br>
This burger logger is created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). This logger follows the MVC design pattern; uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
## Usage
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. Devoured or not, this app will store every burger in a database.
